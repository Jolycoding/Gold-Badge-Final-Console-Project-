# Gold-Badge-Final-Console-Project-

This project has been broke down into 3 separate projects all within the same solution:
CHALLENGE 1: CAFE
CHALLENGE 2: CLAIMS
CHALLENGE 3: BADGES

All 3 challenges are working with the client Komodo. 

In the first challenge I created a new console application menu for Komodo Cafe. The manager is able to create new menu items, delete menu items, and receive a list of all items on the cafe's menu.

In the second challenge I created a new console application for the claims department as there was a bug in its initial software. In this application an agent can move through the items in the que and complete each one out first come, first serve. The agents are able to see the various descriptions and proeprties for the claim and move forward appropriately. 

In the third challenge I created a new console application for their badging system. This program allows security staff members to create a new badge, update door access on an existing badge, delete door access from an existing badge, and show a list with all the badge numbers and door access.
